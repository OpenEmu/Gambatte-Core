-----------
Gambatte JG is an emulator for the Nintendo Game Boy/Game Boy Color.

This is a fork of the final public revision of Gambatte.

This repository lives at https://gitlab.com/jgemu/gambatte

Compiling
---------
Make sure you have The Jolly Good API's header files installed. If you did
not install them, you will be required to include their path in CXXFLAGS.

GNU Make's default behaviour for compiling C++ sources is to use g++. If your
platform of choice uses an unpatched GNU Make, you will need to override the
CXX implicit variable if you wish to use a different compiler.

Options:
  USE_VENDORED_SOXR - Set non-zero to use vendored soxr

Linux:
  make

macOS:
  make

BSD:
  gmake

Windows (MSYS2):
  make

The build will be output to "gambatte/". This directory may be used as is
locally by copying it to your local "cores" directory, or may be installed
system-wide using the "install" target specified in the Makefile.
