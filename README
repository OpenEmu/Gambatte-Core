Gambatte JG
-----------
Gambatte JG is an emulator for the Nintendo Game Boy/Game Boy Color.

Source for the emulator core is unmodified from upstream sources with the
exception of a patch which allows loading content from a memory buffer.
Additionally, the directory structure has been flattened and unneeded code
has been removed.

not install them, you will be required to include their path in CXXFLAGS.
